                        This document, circulated for the MegaGiga Computerclub presentation, focuses on webcam security 
                        and delves into the fundamental mechanisms of webcams, outlining their role in capturing and
                        transmitting video or images to local networks or over the internet.
                        <br><br>
                        The document sheds light on the hardware and software aspects of webcams, emphasizing the significance
                        of understanding protocols such as RTSP, PSIA, and ONVIF commonly employed for audio and video streaming.
                        <br><br>
                        Furthermore, the document delves into the external and internal characteristics of webcams, highlighting
                        the connection methods and protocols used for interaction with webcams. It underscores the significance
                        of recognizing these elements for a comprehensive understanding of webcam functionality. The discussion
                        extends to ways of identifying webcams on the internet, including the use of Google dorking and platforms
                        like Shodan.io for detailed searches of specific devices.

                        At the beginning of 2022, it was, and still is, common understanding that api security
						is a hot item. There is, however, an intersection between api security and other security
						domains that is often not taken into account. Where API security is often focused on
						knowledge of network protocols and fuzzing of interfaces, a deeper danger lurks below the
						surface. A danger that is almost as old as information technology itself, and still very
						much disregarded. Disregarded during education and disregarded in the field. The name of
						that danger is application security.
						<br><br>
						The goal of this article is not to cover the entire field of application security, but to
						give one of the most basic and yet most striking examples of an application security glitch
						that is used all over the place to teach the C programming language.

                        To the surprise of a number of administrators of Raspberry OS (before called Raspbian),
                        the latest update came with an extra software key that permits Microsoft to make
                        changes to the Raspberry OS each time the user or administrator does an update<br><br>
                        It goes without saying that this did not fall well with the Raspberry and Linux communities
                        who have lost their trust in Raspberry and see this case as a confirmation that Microsoft has an 
                        uncontrollable urge to be present on each computer and gather user data, even if it
                        has to be done secretly.

                        From my side, I rather think that it's not artificial intelligence but natural stupidity that
                        will destroy the world. With other words: it's not even sure that Microsoft is aware of
                        the fact that their software is added to Raspbian OS, nor that the Raspberry Pi Foundation
                        was aware of the consequences of their decision to put VScode in Raspberry OS LITE.

                        project were an option, so the authors decided to invest some time in this project.

                        The document is a work in progress and must be read as such, but we got a number of
                        questions about the state of play of this project, so we already make available
                        what we have.

                        This project elaborates on the design of a fully functional Arduino on a business card.
                        All necessary information is given to make it possible to understand the assembling, the
                        programming and the functioning of this Visitekaarduino. This includes the schematics, the
                        PCB design, the bill of materials, some programming code, etc.
                        <br><br>
                        The major challenge was to create a price-competitive business card (for volumes from 250 and
                        more) that gets more attention than a plain vanilla one. So, the overhead cost, like shipping cost,
                        engineering cost, etc. can be a bit higher, as long as the price per board is low enough. The
                        higher the volumes, the more beneficial this Visitekaarduino becomes.

                        Thomas Watson, the president of IBM from 1914 to 1956, said he thought there was a world
                        market "for maybe five computers". Most people today critcise this idea as being one of
                        the worst visions ever. But was it? The question is rather: what is a computer? If we
                        define it as a single machine, then Watson's vision was a little flawed. If, however,
                        we define a computer as a collective of computing power, then maybe Watson was not
                        all that far from the thruth.
                        <br><br>
                        If we look at the computing power collectives, also called clouds, we see a limited number
                        of major players killing (they call it: taking over and integrating, Startrek called it:
                        assimilating) all competition. And what rests are the Microsoft, Google, Amazon, ... clouds
                        (data centers) of this world. Maybe not five, but in each case very few.
                        <br><br>
                        So, what choice do we have, as an individual, as a company, as a government? The computing
                        collectives dictate that we must go to the cloud with our data (even sensitive business or
                        security data). In fact, they don't dictate it, they just make it virtually impossible to
                        keep our data protected within our perimeter. They abandon software that runs in our perimeter.
                        And the software that still runs within our perimeter contacts their infrastructure several
                        times per use we make of it. And, of course, purely with as goal to make their software better,
                        they transfer all kinds of information from our machines to their datacentra.
                        <br><br>
                        All of this has as a consequence that only the economies of a few countries are fed with
                        vast amounts of money, whereas most countries (that do not have one of the major players
                        headquarters on their territory) don't even have a chance to grow a local technology
                        economy, despite their vast quantity of very knowledgeable citizens. And the more data the
                        companies get about us, the more they can use that data to get even more money coming their
                        way.

                        Besides the economic point, there is also the privacy and security point. It is well known
                        that some proprietary software provides access to our machines and our data for certain
                        security agencies. It is well known that some proprietary protocols are designed in a way
                        that there are backdoors to eavesdrop. Sometimes to get an economic advantage, sometimes
                        to get a world dominance advantage, sometimes to suppress a part of the population, ...
                        And still the international community stays mute in most cases. Even governments put their
                        data in the major clouds. Intentional or sheer stupidity?
                        <br><br>
                        Permit me, in this context, to refer to my publication: <a href="#security"><i>"Divided we

                        I believe in stimulating the local economies around the globe by using the economic
                        model of free software with local support. I also believe that free open source software and
                        hardware can be more secure due to more people looking at and contributing to the sources.
                        I believe that all people should get the chance to make a living in the technology branch
                        (call it 'the new economy') and not only the happy few that have the luck to be born at the
                        right place and to work for the right companies. The more people work in technology, the more
                        evolution we will know, and the better the world will be for all of us (and not only for
                        the happy few.

                        On april 7th, 2020 Mr Deacon authored and Mr. Torvalds committed a pull request on the Linux
                        kernel. More specific, from kernel 5.7.7 on, some kallsyms symbols/functions will no longer
                        be exported by the kernel. This has as a consequence that a major number of third party
                        modules will no longer install after an update to the latest kernel version.
                        <br><br>
                        This paper looks into the problem, proposes a number of alternatives, and show how these
                        alternatives can be implemented without causing havoc in the source code of the mentioned
                        modules (read: relatively easy to change once one knows how).

                        of the second test board has been extended with VHDL software testing and breadboard testing.
                        Updates of this document will also handle the creation of a wire-wrapping test board as a

                        We live in an era where data is available on a large scale, and in a plethora of different formats. The
                        major question that arises is no longer if we have the data, or how to find the data, but how to find
                        useful information within the available data and how to decide if the information we find is correct
                        and complete.
                        <br><br>
                        This is not different on the European level in the domain of freedom, security and justice. Of course,
                        there is always data that is not available in a database. But much worse is the fact that data is
                        available more than once in several databases, spread all over Europe, and in multiple formats.
                        How can one be sure that the data one is using are correct and complete, and that different databases
                        don’t store different versions (or erroneous versions) of the same data.
                        <br><br>
                        And what about the Member States? Are they in the possibility to get the necessary data at the right
                        moment in time to take the best possible decisions with regards to the domain of freedom, security
                        and justice. What information are they allowed to get out of the European databases, what
                        information can they technically get out of these databases, and what is the cost for doing so? Let’s
                        not forget that the European budgets are also paid for by the Member States and hence by all of us.

                        The aim of the described study consists in predicting the yarn properties, given the relevant
                        fibre properties and the production conditions. These conditions are determined by the type of
                        machines and their settings. By means of a neural network, it is possible to determine the
                        spinnability of the fibres above, under the given production conditions.

                        Once the spinnability is assured, one can predict the yarn properties by means of multiple
                        interconnected neural networks. A method that does not oversimplify the problem is described
                        in this publication.

                        It is very important for a spinner to be able to predict the degree of spinnability of a given
                        fibre quality. Certain process conditions must be considered here. This article describes how
                        spinnability of a given fibre quality on a rotor and ring spinning machine can be predicted with
                        a reliability of 95% by means of a neural network. The structure and the characteristics of the
                        neural net used will be considered in greater depth, and a simple method of implementation of
                        such a neural net will be dealt with.

                        By now, it's clear to everyone that, especially during the Corona era, the health care
                        workers are the real heroes of a modern society. They put their lives in danger to help Corona
                        (COVID-19) patients. They are in the line of fire in a war with an invisible but lethal enemy.
                        <br><br>
                        Since there is a major shortage of protection materials that these people need, 7 volunteers
                        of Richtpunt campus Zottegem (PTIZ), have taken up the initiative to produce safety masks that
                        can be worn on top of other face protection equipment.
                        <br><br>
                        My role, albeit a small one, was to help gather the means to make masks. Around 8000 masks
                        have been produced and distributed amongst health care workers in hospitals and elderly homes.
