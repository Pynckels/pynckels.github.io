                        <b><big>The Heartbeat of Vulnerability Tracking: Understanding Mitre and CVE</big></b>
                        <br><br>
                        Mitre Corporation stands as a beacon of technological innovation and national security research.
                        Established in 1958, this not-for-profit organization has been instrumental in managing critical
                        cybersecurity infrastructure, most notably the <i>Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)</i>
                        program. The CVE database serves as the global dictionary of known security vulnerabilities,
                        providing a standardized identifier for every publicly disclosed cybersecurity weakness.
                        <br><br>
                        For decades, Mitre has meticulously cataloged and maintained this comprehensive repository,
                        enabling security professionals worldwide to track, understand, and mitigate potential digital
                        threats. Their systematic approach has been fundamental in creating a shared language for
                        cybersecurity researchers, vendors, and organizations.
                        <br><br>
                        <b><big>The Looming Crisis: Funding Withdrawal and Potential Collapse</big></b>
                        <br><br>
                        Recent developments have sent shockwaves through the cybersecurity community. The U.S. Department
                        of Homeland Security (DHS) has signaled the end of the contract that is funding the CVE program,
                        potentially leaving a massive void in global vulnerability tracking. This unexpected move
                        threatens to disrupt the intricate ecosystem of cybersecurity research and threat management.
                        <br><br>
                        The implications are profound. Without a centralized, trusted repository, organizations might
                        struggle to quickly identify and respond to emerging security vulnerabilities. The potential
                        shutdown could create significant information fragmentation and increase cybersecurity risks
                        for governments, corporations, and individual users.
                        <br><br>
                        <b><big>Global Alternatives: Preserving the CVE Legacy</big></b>
                        <br><br>
                        <b><i>European Intervention: A Continental Cybersecurity Response</i></b>
                        <br><br>
                        In the rapidly evolving landscape of global cybersecurity, Europe stands at a critical juncture.
                        The potential shutdown of the MITRE CVE program has sparked intense discussions about the future
                        of vulnerability tracking and digital defense. European nations are uniquely positioned to step
                        forward and assume a pivotal role in maintaining the global cybersecurity ecosystem. The question
                        arises if the European decision-making process is fast enough to take advantage of this
                        opportunity.
                        <br><br>
                        <b><i>Academic Institutions: Guardians of Digital Knowledge</i></b>                        
                        <br><br>
                        Prestigious research universities in democratic nations present another promising alternative.
                        Institutions in Canada, Australia, and various European countries have demonstrated exceptional
                        capabilities in cybersecurity research and management.
                        <br><br>
                        Universities like ETH Zurich, University of Toronto, and UNSW Sydney possess the technological
                        expertise, research infrastructure, and international credibility required to potentially inherit
                        and expand the CVE program's mission.
                        <br><br>
                        <b><big>Potential Challenges in Transition</big></b>
                        <br><br>
                        Transitioning the CVE program will not be without significant challenges. Maintaining the database's
                        comprehensiveness, ensuring global participation, and preserving the established credibility will
                        require substantial resources and international cooperation.
                        <br><br>
                        Technical complexities include maintaining consistent vulnerability identification standards,
                        ensuring real-time updates, and creating a sustainable funding model. Moreover, geopolitical
                        considerations could complicate the transfer of such a sensitive cybersecurity resource.
                        <br><br>
                        <b><big>The Human Element: Community and Collaboration</big></b>
                        <br><br>
                        Beyond institutional mechanisms, the cybersecurity community itself represents a powerful force
                        for continuity. Open-source initiatives, collaborative research platforms, and international
                        cybersecurity conferences could play crucial roles in maintaining vulnerability tracking momentum.
                        <br><br>
                        Professional networks and independent researchers might develop decentralized solutions, potentially
                        creating a more robust, community-driven approach to vulnerability management. In each case, it has
                        become clear that counting on a single solution payed by a single country is obsolete.
                        <br><br>
                        <b><big>Hope on the Horizon: Adaptive Resilience</big></b>
                        <br><br>
                        Despite the current uncertainty, the cybersecurity community has consistently demonstrated remarkable
                        adaptability. Historical precedents show that critical infrastructure rarely disappears entirely but
                        often transforms through innovative solutions.
                        <br><br>
                        Whether through governmental intervention, academic leadership, or community-driven initiatives, the
                        fundamental need for comprehensive vulnerability tracking ensures that some form of the CVE program
                        will likely emerge, potentially stronger and more dynamic than its predecessor. The actual problem is
                        an opportunity for other organisations or countries to shine.

                        At the beginning of 2022, it was, and still is, common understanding that api security
                        is a hot item. There is, however, an intersection between api security and other security
                        domains that is often not taken into account. Where API security is often focused on
                        knowledge of network protocols and fuzzing of interfaces, a deeper danger lurks below the
                          surface. A danger that is almost as old as information technology itself, and still very
                        much disregarded. Disregarded during education and disregarded in the field. The name of
                        that danger is application security.

                        To the surprise of a number of administrators of Raspberry OS (before called Raspbian),
                        the latest update came with an extra software key that permits Microsoft to make
                        changes to the Raspberry OS each time the user or administrator does an update<br><br>
                        It goes without saying that this did not fall well with the Raspberry and Linux communities
                        who have lost their trust in Raspberry and see this case as a confirmation that Microsoft has an 
                        uncontrollable urge to be present on each computer and gather user data, even if it
                        has to be done secretly.

                        From my side, I rather think that it's not artificial intelligence but natural stupidity that
                        will destroy the world. With other words: it's not even sure that Microsoft is aware of
                        the fact that their software is added to Raspbian OS, nor that the Raspberry Pi Foundation
                        was aware of the consequences of their decision to put VScode in Raspberry OS LITE.

                        The Tiny Linux project is aimed at crafting an exceptionally small and efficient Linux
                        distribution, primarily targeting users who need minimal resource consumption without
                        sacrificing core functionalities. This project emphasizes compactness and speed, making it
                        ideal for embedded systems or devices where conserving computational resources is crucial.
                        Despite its reduced size, Tiny Linux strives to maintain a level of usability that supports
                        essential networking and troubleshooting tasks, allowing it to serve effectively in roles
                        such as microservers or educational tools for understanding Linux internals.
                        <br><br>
                        The project is accessible for anyone to use and modify, and encourages contributions through
                        its GitHub repository. The open-source nature ensures that users can tailor the distribution
                        to specific requirements, further enhancing its utility in specialized scenarios. The
                        simplicity of the distribution aligns with the philosophy of empowering developers and enthusiasts
                        to maximize performance while minimizing footprint, ensuring that it remains a versatile and
                        valuable asset in diverse technological applications.

                        The GNU-Linux project is focused on the creation of a minimal GNU/Linux disk image. This
                        image is designed for use with QEMU to facilitate testing applications written for GNU/Linux
                        environments. It stands out for its streamlined architecture, aiming to serve developers
                        and hobbyists looking for a low-overhead platform to test their applications. However, it
                        is essential to note that this image is not intended for production environments, as it
                        lacks essential security features found in more robust distributions.
                        <br><br>
                        The project is accessible to anyone interested, and it provides a straightforward setup
                        process. Users can get started by cloning the repository from GitHub and following the
                        makefile instructions to build the image. While it does not support advanced features like
                        code forks or security monitoring, its simplicity and ease of use make it a great tool for
                        educational purposes and for developers focusing on application testing. Additionally,
                        credits are given to Maple-Circuit for inspiring the project's procedure, further promoting
                        collaboration and learning within the tech community.

                        Thomas Watson, the president of IBM from 1914 to 1956, said he thought there was a world
                        market "for maybe five computers". Most people today critcise this idea as being one of
                        the worst visions ever. But was it? The question is rather: what is a computer? If we
                        define it as a single machine, then Watson's vision was a little flawed. If, however,
                        we define a computer as a collective of computing power, then maybe Watson was not
                        all that far from the thruth.
                        <br><br>
                        If we look at the computing power collectives, also called clouds, we see a limited number
                        of major players killing (they call it: taking over and integrating, Startrek called it:
                        assimilating) all competition. And what rests are the Microsoft, Google, Amazon, ... clouds
                        (data centers) of this world. Maybe not five, but in each case very few.
                        <br><br>
                        So, what choice do we have, as an individual, as a company, as a government? The computing
                        collectives dictate that we must go to the cloud with our data (even sensitive business or
                        security data). In fact, they don't dictate it, they just make it virtually impossible to
                        keep our data protected within our perimeter. They abandon software that runs in our perimeter.
                        And the software that still runs within our perimeter contacts their infrastructure several
                        times per use we make of it. And, of course, purely with as goal to make their software better,
                        they transfer all kinds of information from our machines to their datacentra.
                        <br><br>
                        All of this has as a consequence that only the economies of a few countries are fed with
                        vast amounts of money, whereas most countries (that do not have one of the major players
                        headquarters on their territory) don't even have a chance to grow a local technology
                        economy, despite their vast quantity of very knowledgeable citizens. And the more data the
                        companies get about us, the more they can use that data to get even more money coming their
                        way.

                        Besides the economic point, there is also the privacy and security point. It is well known
                        that some proprietary software provides access to our machines and our data for certain
                        security agencies. It is well known that some proprietary protocols are designed in a way
                        that there are backdoors to eavesdrop. Sometimes to get an economic advantage, sometimes
                        to get a world dominance advantage, sometimes to suppress a part of the population, ...
                        And still the international community stays mute in most cases. Even governments put their
                        data in the major clouds. Intentional or sheer stupidity?

                        I believe in stimulating the local economies around the globe by using the economic
                        model of free software with local support. I also believe that free open source software and
                        hardware can be more secure due to more people looking at and contributing to the sources.
                        I believe that all people should get the chance to make a living in the technology branch
                        (call it 'the new economy') and not only the happy few that have the luck to be born at the
                        right place and to work for the right companies. The more people work in technology, the more
                        evolution we will know, and the better the world will be for all of us (and not only for
                        the happy few.

                        On april 7th, 2020 Mr Deacon authored and Mr. Torvalds committed a pull request on the Linux
                        kernel. More specific, from kernel 5.7.7 on, some kallsyms symbols/functions will no longer
                        be exported by the kernel. This has as a consequence that a major number of third party
                        modules will no longer install after an update to the latest kernel version.

                        The pun1442 project aims to simulate punching a text file into a PDF format with an IBM 1442 retro
                        style look. This process generates punched cards in the resulting PDF file, which can be read back
                        with the rdr1442 project. Examples of outputs from pun1442 can be viewed in the tests directory.
                        Details on how these examples were created can be found in the runtests.sh file within the project
                        repository. The project is still in progress, and feedback is welcome for further improvements.

                        For all the mainframe enthousiast with 'retro sentiments' we have created a little Python project.
                        The GitHub repository "prt1403" provides a program that allows users to print a text file to a PDF
                        in a retro IBM 1403 printer style.
                        <br><br>
                        The tool can be installed on Linux, with instructions provided for setup via git and pip. It
                        supports multiple font options, including two default fonts, FONTMONO and FONT1403, which resemble
                        the original IBM 1403 character set.
                        <br><br>
                        Users can adjust the print style using command-line options for color, font, paper size, and more.
                        The repository includes a detailed README.md file with installation steps, usage instructions,
                        and configuration options for customization.

                        Since some time, the Direction ICT of the Belgian Ministry of Home Affairs is looking
                        into crypto systems. Within that framework, a preliminary
                        study<sup><i style="color: #80C080;">[1]</i></sup>
                        has been made. With this study as a basis, priorities were decided upon, and a first
                        project outline was made. The first priority was the development of a hardware random
                        number generator. Since budgets and staff are limited, outsourcing nor insourcing this
                        project were an option, so the authors decided to invest some time in this project.

                        This project elaborates on the design of a fully functional Arduino on a business card.

                        The major challenge was to create a price-competitive business card (for volumes from 250 and
                        more) that gets more attention than a plain vanilla one. So, the overhead cost, like shipping cost,
                        engineering cost, etc. can be a bit higher, as long as the price per board is low enough. The
                        higher the volumes, the more beneficial this Visitekaarduino becomes.

                        This document is the sequel of the <i>S80 computer Ver. 1.0/i> document. It continues where
                        the previous document ended: the building of the second version of the S80 computer. The
                        boards are smaller, the memory size extended to 2Mb by means of memory mapping.
                        <br><br>
                        This second version is hardware and software compatible with the first version of the S80.
                        <br><br>
                        The focus of this document is on the memory 2.0 board with memory mapping addressing logic.
                        A first test board had flaws in the design (see previous document) and the design cycle
                        of the second test board has been extended with VHDL software testing and breadboard testing.
                        Updates of this document will also handle the creation of a wire-wrapping test board as a
                        final test before ordering test PCB's. Further updates will handle all future steps up until
                        the production version will be available.

                        We live in an era where data is available on a large scale, and in a plethora of different formats. The
                        major question that arises is no longer if we have the data, or how to find the data, but how to find
                        useful information within the available data and how to decide if the information we find is correct
                        and complete.
                        <br><br>
                        This is not different on the European level in the domain of freedom, security and justice. Of course,
                        there is always data that is not available in a database. But much worse is the fact that data is
                        available more than once in several databases, spread all over Europe, and in multiple formats.
                        How can one be sure that the data one is using are correct and complete, and that different databases
                        don’t store different versions (or erroneous versions) of the same data.
                        <br><br>
                        And what about the Member States? Are they in the possibility to get the necessary data at the right
                        moment in time to take the best possible decisions with regards to the domain of freedom, security
                        and justice. What information are they allowed to get out of the European databases, what
                        information can they technically get out of these databases, and what is the cost for doing so? Let’s
                        not forget that the European budgets are also paid for by the Member States and hence by all of us.

                            The aim of the described study consists in predicting the yarn properties, given the relevant
                            fibre properties and the production conditions. These conditions are determined by the type of
                            machines and their settings. By means of a neural network, it is possible to determine the
                            spinnability of the fibres above, under the given production conditions.

                            Once the spinnability is assured, one can predict the yarn properties by means of multiple
                            interconnected neural networks. A method that does not oversimplify the problem is described
                            in this publication.

                            It is very important for a spinner to be able to predict the degree of spinnability of a given
                            fibre quality. Certain process conditions must be considered here. This article describes how
                            spinnability of a given fibre quality on a rotor and ring spinning machine can be predicted with
                            a reliability of 95% by means of a neural network. The structure and the characteristics of the
                            neural net used will be considered in greater depth, and a simple method of implementation of
                            such a neural net will be dealt with.

                            By now, it's clear to everyone that, especially during the Corona era, the health care
                            workers are the real heroes of a modern society. They put their lives in danger to help Corona
                            (COVID-19) patients. They are in the line of fire in a war with an invisible but lethal enemy.
                            <br><br>
                            Since there is a major shortage of protection materials that these people need, 7 volunteers
                            of Richtpunt campus Zottegem (PTIZ), have taken up the initiative to produce safety masks that
                            can be worn on top of other face protection equipment.
                            <br><br>
                            My role, albeit a small one, was to help gather the means to make masks. Around 8000 masks
                            have been produced and distributed amongst health care workers in hospitals and elderly homes.
